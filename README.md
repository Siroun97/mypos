A functioning POS software that can be used for any retail shop cash register system.
The software has a login system that can reguster users and log them in, the users choose their role 
whether a cashier or an Admin, if the admin logs in they go to the a page where they can manage the products
available(add, delete) also end the day of sales showing the total of that day. If a cashier logs in they
go to the main POS where they search for products based on product name and barcode, if the product doesn't
exist it says no product available, if exists it adds the product and its detail on the grid, if the same
product is searched again the quantity increases by one. then other products can be added and deleted as 
needed and then sold when the sell button is pressed and grid is cleared for a new invoice with a receipt
if needed. The invoice is saved on another grid which is the sales history grid that shows every previous 
sales detail until the end of day. It holds and loads unsold invoices and makes discounts either with 
percentages or a determinimg specific amount to pay.
